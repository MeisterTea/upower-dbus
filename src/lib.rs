//! # upower-dbus
//!
//! A Rust library which interfaces with UPower status information through dbus.
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! ### Detecting if the system is running on battery
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate upower_dbus;
//!
//! use upower_dbus::UPower;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     match UPower::new(1000).and_then(|u| u.on_battery()) {
//!         Ok(true) => println!("system is using battery"),
//!         Ok(false) => println!("system is on AC"),
//!         Err(why) => eprintln!("failed to get battery status: {}", why)
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ### Getting the current battery status as a percentage
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate upower_dbus;
//!
//! use std::process::exit;
//! use upower_dbus::UPower;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let upower = match UPower::new(1000) {
//!         Ok(upower) => upower,
//!         Err(why) => {
//!             eprintln!("failed to get dbus connection: {}", why);
//!             exit(1);
//!         }
//!     };
//!
//!     match upower.on_battery() {
//!         Ok(true) => {
//!             match upower.get_percentage() {
//!                 Ok(percentage) => println!("battery is at {}%", percentage),
//!                 Err(why) => {
//!                     eprintln!("could not get battery percentage: {}", why);
//!                     exit(1);
//!                 }
//!             }
//!         }
//!         Ok(false) => println!("battery is not active"),
//!         Err(why) => {
//!             eprintln!("could not get battery status: {}", why);
//!             exit(1);
//!         }
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
